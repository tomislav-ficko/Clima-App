# Clima Application
Weather app made using OpenWeatherMap's API, created as part of the Android Java course by London App Brewery
<br/>
<br/>
Important things used while making this app:<br/>
• MVC design pattern for separating data model from controller<br/>
• Location permissions for fetching device location<br/>
• JSONObject and AsyncHttpClient for communication with OpenWeatherMap API<br/>
• Intents to move between activities (and Extras to share data between them)
